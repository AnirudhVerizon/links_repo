Architecture
Swiggy
They write UI components in React native 
Long running, background intensive, data storage components are written in Native (Android/iOS)

verizon
Very little client side UI written on native(atoms and molecules)
Most of the screens are web pages

Interesting Learnings
No webview screens
Does not focus on omnichannel experience(i.e customer journeys of users on app and web are different)
Dynamically upscales or downscales images that are downloaded from the server based on mobile network strength(low,medium,high)

Possible takeaways for our app
 Uses AV1 Image Format (AVIF) for pictures in its app that are 60% smaller than PNG/JPEG
Shift to more native/react native screens to increase zippyness

Possible AI takeaways
Hyper-localization and hyper-personalization of advertisements and search results
